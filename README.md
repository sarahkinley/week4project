Week 4 Project Assignment
This repisitory is Sarah Kinley's submission for John Hopkins' Getting and Cleaning data Week 4 course project. 

The following Read Me file describes how the script works and the indicates how to access the codebook, where the variables are described. 

Files: 
- codebook.md is the codebook for this project, which describes the variables, data, and transformations that I performed to "tidy" the data

-run_analysis.R performs the data preparation (ex. loading the dataset), followed by the 5 steps outlined in this project: 
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (tidy_dataset.txt)

-SarahData.txt is the final exported data after completing the steps above
